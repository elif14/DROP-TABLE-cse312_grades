# How to print in Flask
Normal print() **does not** work in flask.
Using standard error or flush in print() also **does not** work.
```
print('Hello world!', file=sys.stderr)
print('Hello world!', flush=True)
```
Only reliable method I was able to find is using [logger](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/logging/).
```
import logging
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/print')
def printMsg():
    app.logger.warning('testing warning log')
    app.logger.error('testing error log')
    app.logger.info('testing info log')
    return "Check your console"
```
However, since we are using [Blueprint](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/blueprints/) to organize different files and functionalities, we need to use small twist to this method by importing [current_app](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16994174/in-flask-how-to-access-app-logger-within-blueprint).
```
from flask import current_app
current_app.logger.info('Hello world!')
```
# Blueprint 101
Blueprint is extremely powerful and useful. There are more to Blueprint but our main purpose is to encapsulate our code/file. 
By separating one mega py file to many different py files, we'll be able to organize the code and functionality better.
Easier to maintain, understand, and less likely to have merge conflicts.
